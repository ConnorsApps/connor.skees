It's me, Connor! This is my business card. It's better for the environment and easy to distribute. Enjoy.

# Usage

## npm

```
npx connor.skees
```

## GitHub Package Registry

Assuming you have the GitHub registry set up, you can use via npx:

```
npx connor.skees
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
